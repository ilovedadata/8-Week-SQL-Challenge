### A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
~~~sql

### B. Data Analysis Questions

1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;
~~~

| count |
| ----- |

2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
~~~sql

~~~

### C. Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
