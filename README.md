# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge

This repo contains some SQL code I wrote in order to tackle Danny Ma's **8 week SQL challenge**. The challenge can be found here 👉 https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ 👈

The goal I set before taking on this challenge was to improve my SQL skills. This is why the code I wrote at the beginning of the challenge (week 1) might be quite a bit different from the code I wrote towards the end of it.
